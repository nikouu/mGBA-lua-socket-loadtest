# mGBA-lua-socket-loadtest

This work continues from [mGBA-lua-Socket](https://github.com/nikouu/mGBA-lua-Socket) in order to hone the socket functionality used in [mGBA-http](https://github.com/nikouu/mGBA-http).

This project has three performance goals: 
1. Find the cleanest way to connect and disconnect sockets
2. Find the throughput limits
3. Explore multiplexing

## Preface

This document will go through each Git tag milestone to explain in depth what's being explored and why. 

The structure of the work loosely matches mGBA-http with an HTTP endpoint that calls an injected `SocketService` object.

When the .NET server is running, the message can be sent via:
```
https://localhost:7185/mgbaendpoint?message=a
```

[heroldev/AGB-buttontest](https://github.com/heroldev/AGB-buttontest) is the ROM used when running mGBA.

# Version 1 - Base state

[Tag link](https://github.com/nikouu/mGBA-lua-socket-loadtest/tree/Version1)

Version 1 brings starts this project with:
1. Singleton `SocketService`
2. Lua script from [mGBA-lua-Socket](https://github.com/nikouu/mGBA-lua-Socket) modified to reflect back the given message

While there will be issues when sending many messages at once due to the singleton socket, this version will only deal with simple messages now and again.

# Version 2 - Automatic socket cleanup on app close

[Tag link](https://github.com/nikouu/mGBA-lua-socket-loadtest/tree/Version2)

## Handling socket cleanup on close

This version begins to look at how to deal with the different ways mGBA-http can be closed.

When closing the server, the message from mGBA is inconsistent. I'm unsure if it's because the IDisposable of `SocketServer` isn't correctly run on shutdown or if there is something else. This is a problem in mGBA-http. The message on closing the server will be either:
1. [ERROR] Socket 1 Error: disconnected
1. [ERROR] Socket 1 Error: unknown error

Either one happens after a connect-request-disconnect cycle. However closing the debugged application via the stop in Visual Studio more often does the "disconnected" message (or via Ctrl + C in the console), whereas closing the console window with the "x" seems to mostly do the "unknown error" message.

![Version 1 disconnected](images/version1_disconnected.jpg)
![Version 1 unknown error](images/version1_unknownError.jpg)

I assume it's something to do with how the OS./NET sends kill/close messages to the process when using different close methods. Looking into it:

The `Dispose()` method is called when Ctrl + C is used. But doesn't seem to get called with the other closure methods. Which now seems odd bceause we get into this state:

| Closure method    | `Dispose()` runs? | `Lifetime.ApplicationStopping` runs? | mGBA socket close                                |
| ----------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Ctrl + C          | Yes               | Yes                                  | "disconnected"                                   |
| Close button      | No                | No                                   | "unknown error"                                  |
| VS stop debugging | No                | No                                   | Mostly "disconnected", sometimes "unknown error" |

_Technically closure meathods can also be application close or application kill from the Task Manager or command prompt._

I anticipate that most people will close mGBA-http with the close "x" button meaning it will be worth better understanding how the shutdown works in that case. Though it seems that even with these exit hooks, the socket can't be closed cleanly:

```csharp
// 1. Relying on the usual hooks to dispose

// 2. Using Lifetime.ApplicationStopping
app.Lifetime.ApplicationStopping.Register(() =>
{

});

// 3. Using the ProcessExit callback
AppDomain.CurrentDomain.ProcessExit += (s, e) => {

};
```

Ultimately then this probably has to be handled in the Lua script to deal with abrupt socket closures that lead to "unknown error". This can be updated by adding:
```lua
if err ~= socket.ERRORS.AGAIN then
	console:log("ST_received 5")
	if err == "disconnected" then
		console:log("ST_received 6")
		console:log(ST_format(id, err, true))
	elseif err == socket.ERRORS.UNKNOWN_ERROR then
		console:log("ST_received 7")
		console:log(ST_format(id, err, true))
	else
		console:log("ST_received 8")
		console:error(formatMessage(id, err, true))
	end
	ST_stop(id)
end
```

Where we can have the option of swallowing the error.

## socket.ERRORS.AGAIN

It seems every request will have the "socket.ERRORS.AGAIN" error. Even the two example lua scripts [[1](https://github.com/mgba-emu/mgba/blob/c33a0d65344984294ed8666e98d1735a29f0a2d8/res/scripts/socketserver.lua#L37)][[2](https://github.com/mgba-emu/mgba/blob/c33a0d65344984294ed8666e98d1735a29f0a2d8/res/scripts/sockettest.lua#L39)] from the mGBA repo ignore this error. Meaning this can ignore it too.

# Version 3 - Manual socket closing

[Tag link](https://github.com/nikouu/mGBA-lua-socket-loadtest/tree/Version3)

Version 3 is around manually cleaning up a socket. Ensuring that future work can be correctly cleaned up outside of the `Dispose()` call in `SocketService.cs`. 

For this, a new socket will be created inside the `SocketService` singleton for each request then cleaned up afterwards. This can automatically be done with `using`:

```csharp
public async Task<string> SendMessageAsync(string message)
{
    var ipAddress = IPAddress.Parse("127.0.0.1");
    var ipEndpoint = new IPEndPoint(ipAddress, 8888);
    using var socket = new Socket(ipEndpoint.AddressFamily, SocketType.Stream, ProtocolType.Tcp); // using declaration for automatic cleanup

    await socket.ConnectAsync(ipEndpoint);

    var messageBytes = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(message);
    await socket.SendAsync(messageBytes, SocketFlags.None);

    var buffer = new byte[1_024];
    var received = await socket.ReceiveAsync(buffer, SocketFlags.None);
    var response = Encoding.UTF8.GetString(buffer, 0, received);

    return response;
}
```

Which correctly triggers the "disconnected" status in mGBA.

But to better understand the situation we can clean up the socket ourselves:

```csharp
public async Task<string> SendMessageAsync(string message)
{
    var ipAddress = IPAddress.Parse("127.0.0.1");
    var ipEndpoint = new IPEndPoint(ipAddress, 8888);
    var socket = new Socket(ipEndpoint.AddressFamily, SocketType.Stream, ProtocolType.Tcp);

    await socket.ConnectAsync(ipEndpoint);

    var messageBytes = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(message);
    await socket.SendAsync(messageBytes, SocketFlags.None);

    var buffer = new byte[1_024];
    var received = await socket.ReceiveAsync(buffer, SocketFlags.None);
    var response = Encoding.UTF8.GetString(buffer, 0, received);

    socket.Shutdown(SocketShutdown.Both);
    socket.Close();
    socket.Dispose();            

    return response;
}
```

That seems to be a pattern people use a lot even though `.Close()` doesn't do much and also calls `.Dispose()` [under the hood](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/1d1bf92fcf43aa6981804dc53c5174445069c9e4/src/libraries/System.Net.Sockets/src/System/Net/Sockets/Socket.cs#L942).

![Version 3 disconnected](images/version3_disconnected.jpg)
Note: The error states aren't errored because in version 2 they were changed to regular logging calls.

With that knowledge we can continue with using declaration in the first code example above. This also means that every socket will be properly cleaned up (assuming there's no message in-flight) with whatever way a user closes mGBA-http.

## Version 4 - Load testing

Now that we understand the connections to mGBA, it's time to start benchmarking. Version 4 brings in the load testing client. Here is the baseline of the socket code from version 3:

| Requests per second | Actual requests per second | Average latency (ms) | Max latency (ms) | Success rate |
| ------------------: | -------------------------: | -------------------: | ---------------: | -----------: |
|                   1 |                       1.00 |                   32 |              264 |         100% |
|                   2 |                       1.98 |                   28 |              245 |         100% |
|                   3 |                       2.95 |                   32 |              279 |         100% |
|                   4 |                       3.79 |                   37 |              282 |          96% |
|                   5 |                       4.83 |                   31 |              218 |          98% |
|                  10 |                       9.50 |                   70 |            1,465 |          97% |
|                  15 |                      14.23 |                  908 |            8,476 |          97% |
|                  20 |                       9.78 |               10,758 |           32,102 |          79% |

I ran these a few times but there was always a lot of variability. Which was also my experience during mGBA-http and with the errors back in version 2. Often the 1-5 request per second lot will hover around 99% success too.

For all scenarios, it looks like:
1. The requests back up, see max latency
2. The average latency for small RPS is around 30ms
3. The requests per second really drop off at above 15

Our limiting factor is on the mGBA side - at least for how everything has been written for version 4. 

I'd like to set a goal of a consistent 100% success rate at under 60ms max latency for five requests per second for this project. I suspect a lot of the latency is the establishing and closing sockets as each request opens and disposes of a socket. 

Meaning next up, we can try socket pooling.

## Version 5 - Socket pooling

I think(?) the idea of socket pooling is a little difficult because TCP stockets are stateful. However we're always going to be sending to the same endpoint so I think that makes it okay(?). I also have no idea how mGBA will handle having concurrent requests on the same socket. Both thoughts will be addressed by:

1. Creating a socket pool in C#
2. During the load testing, pass a new GUID for every message and check that the correct GUID gets returned

.NET comes with a generic object pool in the form of [Microsoft.Extensions.ObjectPool](Microsoft.Extensions.ObjectPool) and I anticipate that a few sockets can be created and reused. The crux of this work is: 

```csharp
public class ReusableSocket : IResettable, IDisposable
{
    private readonly Socket _socket;
    private readonly IPEndPoint _ipEndpoint;

    public ReusableSocket(string ipAddress, int port)
    {

        var address = IPAddress.Parse("127.0.0.1");
        _ipEndpoint = new IPEndPoint(address, port);
        _socket = new Socket(_ipEndpoint.AddressFamily, SocketType.Stream, ProtocolType.Tcp);
    }

    public async Task<string> SendMessageAsync(string message)
    {
        if (!_socket.Connected)
        {
            await _socket.ConnectAsync(_ipEndpoint);
        }

        var messageBytes = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(message);
        await _socket.SendAsync(messageBytes, SocketFlags.None);

        var buffer = new byte[1_024];
        var received = await _socket.ReceiveAsync(buffer, SocketFlags.None);
        var response = Encoding.UTF8.GetString(buffer, 0, received);

        return response;
    }

    public bool TryReset()
    {
        return true;
    }

    public void Dispose()
    {
        _socket?.Dispose();
        GC.SuppressFinalize(this);
    }
}
```

Since we'll be reusing the socket in the same state, there's no need to reset. Now on each call, we inject in the pool to get a socket from:

```csharp
app.MapGet("/mgbaendpoint", async (ObjectPool<ReusableSocket> socketPool, string message) =>
{
    var socket = socketPool.Get();

    try
    {
        return await socket.SendMessageAsync(message);
    }
    finally
    {
        socketPool.Return(socket);
    }
});
```

Via the IoC setup, this will give us a socket dedicated for that request. If there are idle sockets in the pool it will use one of those, and if there are no sockets left, it will use the `ReusableSocketPooledObjectPolicy` class to create one (see the source for more details).

At the same time, a slight modification to use a new GUID for every request can be done so we can ensure the right response is returning to the right request. 

Running the benchmarks again:

| Requests per second | Actual requests per second | Average latency (ms) | Max latency (ms) | Success rate |
| ------------------: | -------------------------: | -------------------: | ---------------: | -----------: |
|                   1 |                          1 |                   43 |              240 |         100% |
|                   2 |                       1.97 |                   36 |              314 |         100% |
|                   3 |                       2.95 |                   33 |              246 |         100% |
|                   4 |                       3.92 |                   29 |              297 |         100% |
|                   5 |                       4.90 |                   29 |              274 |         100% |
|                  10 |                       9.76 |                   29 |              361 |         100% |
|                  15 |                      10.43 |                5,122 |           12,935 |          81% |
|                  20 |                            |                      |                  |              |

When hitting around 15 RPS it starts to fall apart, and mysteriously this error begins to fail requests:
> System.Net.Sockets.SocketException (10056): A connect request was made on an already connected socket.

But how? Due to the object pool each inbound HTTP request get its own instance of `ReusableSocket` i.e. there's no non-threadsafe action (as far as I know). And how could the connection check be false, triggering a reconnect, but then throwing an exception saying the connection already exists?

```csharp
 public async Task<string> SendMessageAsync(string message)
 {
     if (!_socket.Connected)
     {
         await _socket.ConnectAsync(_ipEndpoint);
     }

    // --
 }
```

Part of it is that the `Connect` property on `Socket` indicates the [connection state as of the _last operation_](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.sockets.socket.connected?view=net-9.0#remarks). Meaning in that time the connection may have been dropped from the other side? Though if that's the case, and on a previous call the socket failed, how does the `ConnectAsync()` call fail if the socket is apparently in a disconnected state? This I have no idea about.

It could be something to do with the first exception that gets thrown during a load test:
>System.Net.Sockets.SocketException (10054): An existing connection was forcibly closed by the remote host.

Where I assume the socket is in a bad state. This would cause the `Connect` property to be false, but I wonder if the other side isn't resilient enough to have properly closed the connection? This would mean this socket should be properly closed, and a new socket used. 

While for a "regular" number of calls, the success rate is now 100% and average latency low my goal wasn't reached (yet) and higher RPS fail. It's time to introduce retries.
